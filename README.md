# PU-Login-CLI
  Updated 6 hours ago This CLI enables user to login to PU(Panjab University, Chandigarh) WiFi. This was implemented in python 3. This project was made as it takes long time to open Browser and then Log In.
Just run the pulogin.py with Python3 on terminal.
It also gives exceptions if the password is wrong, or user is logged in somewhere else.
